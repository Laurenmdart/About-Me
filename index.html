<p> My name is Lauren, I also go by Lo :)
    I am a Senior, Art Major, & Digital Arts Minor. I also work as a jr. graphic designer and am looking forward to learning how I can implement code into my work flow to make things more customizable. I transferred here from the Bay Area about a year ago for UCI, brought my boyfriend and our fur child along with me. A few things I enjoy is creating digital art, playing games, cooking, the outdoors, & galleries. I am excited to learn a new digital language alongside my fellow creatives!
